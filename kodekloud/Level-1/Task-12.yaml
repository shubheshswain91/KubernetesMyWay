# Update an Existing Deployment in Kubernetes

# There is an application deployed on Kubernetes cluster. Recently, the Nautilus application development team developed a new version of the 
# application that needs to be deployed now. As per new updates some new changes need to be made in this existing setup. 
# So update the deployment and service as per details mentioned below:

# We already have a deployment named nginx-deployment and service named nginx-service. Some changes need to be made in this deployment and service, 
# make sure not to delete the deployment and service.

# 1.) Change the service nodeport from 30008 to 32165
