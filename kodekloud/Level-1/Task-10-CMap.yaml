# Kubernetes Time Check Pod

# The Nautilus DevOps team want to create a time check pod in a particular Kubernetes namespace and record the logs. 
# This might be initially used only for testing purposes, but later can be implemented in an existing cluster. 
# Please find more details below about the task and perform it.


# Create a pod called time-check in the datacenter namespace. This pod should run a container called time-check, 
# container should use the busybox image with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e busybox:latest.

# Create a config map called time-config with the data TIME_FREQ=3 in the same namespace.

# The time-check container should run the command: while true; do date; sleep $TIME_FREQ;done and should write the 
# result to the location /opt/security/time/time-check.log. Remember you will also need to add an environmental variable TIME_FREQ in the container, 
# which should pick value from the config map TIME_FREQ key.

# Create a volume log-volume and mount the same on /opt/security/time within the container.


# k create ns datacenter

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: time-config
  namespace: datacenter
data:
  TIME_FREQ: "3"
