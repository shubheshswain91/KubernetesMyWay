# Rollback a Deployment in Kubernetes

comment: >
  This morning the Nautilus DevOps team rolled out a new release for one of the applications. 
  Recently one of the customers logged a complaint which seems to be about a bug related to the recent release. 
  Therefore, the team wants to rollback the recent release.
  There is a deployment named nginx-deployment; roll it back to the previous revision.

task: >
  thor@jump_host ~$ kubectl rollout history deployment nginx-deployment
  deployment.apps/nginx-deployment 
  REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
  1         <none>
  2         kubectl set image deployment nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:alpine-perl --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/config --record=true

  thor@jump_host ~$ kubectl rollout undo deployment nginx-deployment --to-revision=N
  error: invalid argument "N" for "--to-revision" flag: strconv.ParseInt: parsing "N": invalid syntax
  See 'kubectl rollout undo --help' for usage.
  thor@jump_host ~$ kubectl rollout undo deployment nginx-deployment --to-revision=1
  deployment.apps/nginx-deployment rolled back
  thor@jump_host ~$ kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment
  NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
  nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           5m53s
  thor@jump_host ~$ kubectl rollout status deployment nginx-deployment
  deployment "nginx-deployment" successfully rolled out
