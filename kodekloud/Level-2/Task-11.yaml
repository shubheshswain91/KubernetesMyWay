# One of the DevOps team member was trying to install a WordPress website on a LAMP stack which is essentially deployed on Kubernetes cluster.
#  It was working well and we could see the installation page a few hours ago. However something is messed up with the stack now due to a website went down.
#   Please look into the issue and fix it:



# FYI, deployment name is lamp-wp and its using a service named lamp-service. The Apache is using http default port and nodeport is 30008. 
# From the application logs it has been identified that application is facing some issues while connecting to the database in addition to other issues. 
# Additionally, there are some environment variables associated with the pods like MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, MYSQL_DATABASE,  MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD, MYSQL_HOST.


# Also do not try to delete/modify any other existing components like deployment name, service name, types, labels etc.


# Solution

# k get all
# go to the service node of lamp-service and fix the node port to 30008 instead of 30009

# then go to the container 

# k exec -it pod/lamp-pod-xyz -c httpd-service -- /bin/bash
# vi /app/index.php

# fix the typos to MYSQL_PASSWORD and MYSQL_HOST
# service apache2 restart
# exit 

 # Now the service should be good to go.
